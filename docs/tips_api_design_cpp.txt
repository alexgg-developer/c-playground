-Data members of a class should always be declared private, never public or protected. p.31
-Never return non const pointers or ferences to private data members. This breaks encapsulation. p.32
-You can use the pimpl idiom or static function to hide private methods and move them from the header to the cpp. p.33.
-You can declare POD that it is used only in a class as a nested private class. p.33.
-Prefer enums to booleans to improve code readability or for more complex cases where an enum is insufficient, you could even introduce new classes to
ensure that each argument has a unique type. In general avoid functions with multiple parameters of the same type. p.41-42
